Mr Abbott says the report is a damning indictment of the unions that dominate the building industry. \"As the commission\\'s report makes abundantly clear, maintaining a closed shop routinely involves unlawful coercion and intimidation backed by threats of violence,\" Mr Abbott said. \"Breaking agreements, ignoring previous undertakings and flouting industrial commission court orders are all part of maintaining the union rules culture of the industry.\" Commissioner Cole has cited 230 separate incidents of unlawful conduct in Western Australia, 58 in Victoria, 55 in Queensland and 25 in New South Wales. Mr Cole says there is widespread disregard for the law throughout Australia, particularly with regard to enterprise bargaining provisions and occupational health and safety laws. Mr Abbott says the report displays \"a travesty of unionism\" and a new body is needed to investigate criminal behaviour in building and construction.

The 20-year-old Turkish national commandeered the plane shortly after it took off from Istanbul late Friday, forcing the Airbus A310 to divert to the Greek capital Athens from its intended destination Ankara. The Turkish Airlines plane was carrying 194 passengers and nine crew - among them several Turkish parliamentarians, a former minister and senior officials, some of whom were instrumental in bringing a bloodless end to the incident. State secretary in charge of transportation, Manolis Stratakis, said hijack suspect Ozgur Gencaslas seemed \"to have psychological problems\". Mr Stratakis told a press conference at Athens Airport the hijacker remained on board with the two pilots once he let everyone else go. Special forces arrested him when a translator went aboard to help negotiate the terms of his surrender with Greek police. In Ankara, Turkish officials said there were no apparent connections to terrorism in the hijacking, which lasted about three and a half hours. The hijacker decided to release the passengers after speaking on the telephone with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Transportation Minister Binali Yildirim told reporters. \"The man told us that his mother and his sister were being detained in Germany and that he was suffering,\" Mr Yildirim said. Mr Erdogan, he said, had called the mobile phone of one of the legislators on board, who then passed it to the hijacker. \"We talked intensively with him to convince him (to give himself up). I believe he felt we trusted him and he decided to end his action,\" the minister said. A relieved Greek Foreign Minister, George Papandreou, said all passengers were safe and sound. \"All the passengers are free, the families of those who were on the plane can feel reassured,\" he told Turkish news channel CNN-Turk. \"Everything went well.\" The plane landed a few minutes past 22:00GMT at Athens airport, where a tense standoff began with special forces surrounding the aircraft. Greek Government spokesman Christos Protopapas warned they would storm the plane if it became necessary. The Turkish television station had reported the hijacker had explosives with him, though Mr Yildirim strongly denied that. It would have been \"impossible to go through two security checkpoints (at Istanbul airport) with explosives\", he said, adding he did not know what kind of weapon was used to threaten the pilots. The suspect was a resident of Germany but travelled regularly to Turkey. Problems connected with his military service in Turkey had prevented him from leaving.\\n',\n",

       " 'TEXT Federal Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock denies the arrival of a boat of suspected asylum seekers off the Western Australian coast indicates problems with border patrols. The boat carrying about 50 passengers, believed to be Vietnamese, was intercepted yesterday by the Port Hedland Port Authority rather than Coastwatch or navy surveillance crews. It is the first intercepted vessel near Australia since December 2001. The group will be transported to a detention centre at Christmas Island for questioning by immigration authorities. Mr Ruddock says surveillance teams had been on alert for a vessel sighted in the region last month. He says there will be an inquiry into any shortcomings in border patrols. \"We manage the border control issues very comprehensively, but because you do that doesn\\'t mean that there won\\'t be occasions in which a vessel might breach those arrangements in the way in which it has,\" he said. \"I don\\'t seek to blame people about these matters, I mean you\\'re looking at a very large ocean and sometimes quite small boats.\" He says it is an isolated incident. But the Federal Opposition says if Australia had a dedicated coast guard, the boat would not have come within a few kilometres of the coast. Labor\\'s Mark Latham says defence resources are being stretched and a coast guard would provide better border protection. \"The Navy can\\'t do everything, they can\\'t be fighting wars committed on the other side of the world, committed in the Solomons and other places, and still have effective coastal surveillance and coastal policing in place,\" Mr Latham said. \"We really do need a dedicated service that will do the job properly.\" The Australian Democrats say the boat\\'s arrival indicates millions of dollars are being wasted on surveillance operations. Democrats leader Andrew Bartlett says taxpayers\\' money should be redirected to more serious problems. \"We\\'re continuing to waste enormous amounts of money, millions and millions of dollars, unnecessarily scanning for asylum seekers who obviously, it would now seem, can get through that screening anyway, when we should be looking at issues that are a real threat such as drug smuggling,\" Senator Bartlett said. Federal Justice Minister Senator Chris Ellison has backed Mr Ruddock, saying Australia\\'s border protection mechanisms are working effectively. \"We believe this is a one-off situation and you have to remember we had great cooperation from Indonesia,\" he said. \"They\\'ve got two vessels which are being processed in Indonesia. \"We\\'ve no evidence to indicate this represents a systemic change but of course what it does say is that you can\\'t be complacent. \"We believe that people smugglers are always looking for opportunities.\" Mr Ruddock says the asylum seekers\\' claims will be processed on Christmas Island because it will deliver the fairest and quickest outcome. Greens Senator Bob Brown has labelled the move \"the original One Nation solution\", saying the Immigration Department is denying asylum seekers access to Australian law. Senator Brown says the group has come from Vietnam, described by the United States as a repressive state with a poor human rights record. But Mr Ruddock says it is likely the people are economic refugees and processing their claims outside Australia\\'s migration zone means there will not be drawn-out appeals and court claims. \"The longer you keep people here, the more you build up expectations amongst others - maybe they have achieved something,\" he said. \"That\\'s the rationale behind wanting to deal with these issues fairly, properly, but promptly.\" The federal president of a Vietnamese community group is concerned the boat\\'s passengers will not get fair treatment because Australia does not recognise the human rights abuses he says are occuring in Vietnam. Trung Doan from Vietnamese Community Australia says taking the asylum seekers to Christmas Island will limit their rights. \"I\\'m concerned that Immigration Department officials may, either out of prejudice or out of lack of knowledge about the human rights abuses in Vietnam, may wrongly reject them,\" he said. \"And because they\\'re in an excise zone, they have no opportunity to be reheard.\" Refugee advocate Marion Le agrees the decision to move the detainees to Christmas Island raises fresh concerns about the Government\\'s mandatory detention policy. \"Why are they being escorted back to Christmas Island when in the past people are just taken straight on to Port Hedland where of course we have a long-term detention centre?\" Judith McVeigh from the Victorian Refugee Action Collective says the people on board the boat should be given access to Australian courts to apply for asylum. \"It looks like this boat has made it to Australian territory and they should have access to Australian courts,\" she said.\\n',\n",

Prime Minister John Howard says the Labor Party is soft on border protection for voting to disallow the regulation. \"The excision of the island acts as a deterrent to people who want to come here illegally and by voting against that approach the Labor party is saying it wants it easier for people to come here,\" he said. \"You can\\'t have it both ways you, can\\'t say you are in favour of tough border protection rules and then strike down those very rules.\" Labor\\'s Nick Sherry told the Senate the islands should be part of Australia\\'s migration zone. \"Cutting out islands from Australia\\'s sovereignty is just the start. What will come next? The Liberal Government is saying to the people smugglers \\'the more you come, the more we will give up\\',\" he said. \"Once the people smugglers start coming to the mainland, the next logical move in this game is to excise parts of the mainland.\" Earlier, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the return of a boat with 14 asylum-seekers to Indonesia showed tough policies were working. Mr Downer said Australia towed the boat back to Indonesia two weeks ago as part of the effort to thwart people-smugglers. He told Parliament that the arrival of only two unauthorised boats in Australia in the last two years showed the policy was a success. \"I particularly refer to the regional cooperation arrangements we\\'ve had in place with Indonesia since the year 2000, that\\'ve allowed the International Organisation for Migration to care for potential illegal immigrants and the UNHCR to process asylum claims,\" he said \"Since the year 2000, more than 3,900 people have been processed in this way, that\\'s 3,900 people who would have come to Australia illegally if it hadn\\'t been for the cooperation we\\'ve had with Indonesia.\" Mr Downer said 19 countries in Asia have adopted legislation to make people-smuggling a crime and another 12 countries in the region were considering similar laws.\\n',\n",

The education chief for Ohio\\'s sixth largest school district cancelled classes for a second consecutive day following the discovery that two school buses had been struck by bullets in a zone where a sniper has been operating. Investigators have not been able to conclusively link the bus shootings to a string of 16 other, apparently random, shootings that have left one person dead and set this area on edge. \"Investigators are confident that both were bullet strikes,\" Franklin County police chief deputy Steve Martin said on Wednesday. \"However there has been no ballistic evidence recovered to compare with other cases.\" Both buses were struck earlier this week, but the dents near the vehicles\\' rear tail lights were only discovered Wednesday by a mechanic checking the school district\\'s bus fleet for body work and a sharp-eyed bus driver, officials said. The bullets did not penetrate the frame of either vehicle and it is not clear if any children were on board at the time of the incidents, according to a spokesman for the South Western City School district in Franklin County, Ohio. But at least one of the vehicles is thought to have been struck in the general vicinity of a home which was hit by two bullets at the weekend, one of which was recovered from a second-floor bathroom.

Law enforcement officials had to hire a van to take all the materials away. Maasmechelen is a village close to the Dutch city of Maastricht and some 20 kilometres from the German border.

Details of Mr Habib\\'s transfer to Australia are still being worked out but he is not expected to set foot on US soil after he leaves Guantanamo Bay.

I want to tell you that I am innocent of all the crimes of which I am accused.\" He said he would \"cooperate with international justice\" for the sake of Kosovo\\'s future, but warned that the international community had blundered by treating \"freedom fighters and aggressors in the same way\". \"Everything is the result of the inventions of Belgrade and the horse-trading that some quarters have engaged in with Belgrade to ensure the transfer of Serb criminals (to The Hague),\" he said. A minister in the Kosovo Government told AFP that Haradinaj would go to the court. \"He has been indicted by The Hague and he\\'s going to The Hague.\" he said on condition of anonymity. The minister did not elaborate on the nature of the indictment, which has not been made public. Haradinaj was a rebel commander in western Kosovo during the separatist war against Serbian forces, and was questioned last year by UN war crimes investigators. The ethnic Albanian is also wanted by Belgrade on 108 counts of alleged war crimes against Serb civilians during the war in the southern Serbian province, which is now under UN and NATO administration. The authorities in Belgrade have vowed to arrest him if he ever sets foot in Serbia, where he is accused of committing 67 murders, ordering 267 others and kidnapping some 400 during the war. Haradinaj called on Kosovo Albanians to continue their struggle for an independent state and nominated political ally Bajram Kosumi to take over as prime minister. \"I ask everybody to continue on the path of building the state of Kosovo,\" he said in a brief statement. Serbia called on the United Nations to annul Haradinaj\\'s appointment as prime minister after elections in October, saying his leadership was inconsistent with prospects for peace and multi-ethnic democracy in Kosovo. But Haradinaj remains a hero to many Kosovo Albanians, who demand independence from Serbia and see him as a freedom fighter who helped liberate Kosovo from Serbian oppression. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, (NATO) which has more than 18,000 peacekeepers in Kosovo, has already warned the Government in the mainly ethnic Albanian province that any violent reaction to Haradinaj\\'s indictment would not be tolerated. In Brussels, NATO chief Jaap de Hoop Scheffer hailed Haradinaj\\'s cooperation with the UN War Crimes Tribunal, and urged Kosovars to behave responsibly after his resignation. \"I am confident that Ramush Haradinaj will, as he has announced, meet his obligations and cooperate fully with the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia,\" the NATO secretary general said in a statement. And European Union (EU) enlargement commissioner Olli Rehn said Haradinaj\\'s decision to resign was \"wise.\" \"This is a bold and wise decision. I appreciate Mr Haradinaj\\'s willingness to comply immediately with international law,\" he said. \"I encourage the people of Kosovo to respect Mr Haradinaj\\'s calls for them to remain calm. Violence of any kind will not be tolerated, and it would work against the interests of the people of Kosovo,\" he added. The United States, meanwhile, warned US citizens in Kosovo to take extra security precautions and avoid possible demonstrations against the indictment.\\n',\n",

       " 'TEXT US doctors may today turn off the feeding tube of a Florida woman who has been in a vegetative state for 15 years while her husband and parents fight over whether she should be kept alive. A court has ruled the tube can be removed from 41-year-old Terri Schiavo at 1:00pm [local time]. However, legislators in Florida and Washington are trying to pass legislation to stop the move and activist groups across America have taken up Ms Schiavo\\'s case. Ms Schiavo\\'s heart stopped in 1990 inflicting severe brain damage and she has been in hospital ever since. Doctors have said her condition is irreversible and her husband, Michael Schiavo, says his wife told him she would not want to be kept alive artificially. Her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, have fought attempts to let their daughter die, insisting she could get better. Experts have said Ms Schiavo would die in about two weeks if the tube is taken out. In the final hours, the parents and their supporters fought desperately to stop that happening. They appealed to the US Supreme Court, and Florida Circuit Court Judge George Greer scheduled a hearing to consider a request from Florida to halt the removal of the tube. The Florida House of Representatives passed a bill to block the withholding of food and water from patients in a persistent vegetative state, who did not leave specific instructions regarding their care. T The Florida Senate defeated a different bill on the same topic. The US Congress also passed rival motions that will need intense efforts to be made into workable legislation. The House of Representatives voted late Wednesday to give federal courts the power to review cases where life support patients do not leave written instructions on whether they want to be kept alive. But the Senate on Thursday approved a measure that only mentions Ms Schiavo and would allow a final medical review in her case. House leaders were irate, saying that the Senate\\'s failure to adopt their version of the bill may have doomed Ms Schiavo. \"As Terri Schiavo lays helpless in Florida, one day away from the unthinkable and unforgivable, the Senate Democrats refused to join Republicans to act on her behalf,\" Republican House Majority Leader Tom DeLay and Speaker Dennis Hastert said in a joint statement. For their part, Senate leaders expressed satisfaction over their version of the legislation. \"To knowingly and purposely starve Ms Schiavo to death would be callous, cruel and immoral,\" Bill Frist, the head of the Republican majority in the Senate, said. House and Senate leaders worked through the night in hopes of reaching some last-minute compromise between both bills. \"We\\'re going to be here very late tonight. We may very well be here tomorrow,\" said Republican Senator for Pennsylvania Rick Santorum. Asked if President George W Bush would sign a bill preventing Ms Schiavo\\'s demise, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said that \"the president stands on the side of defending life.\" Mr Bush released a statement acknowledging that in complex cases such as Schiavo\\'s \"our society, our laws and our courts should have a presumption in favour of life.\" The United States, like the two sides of the tragic woman\\'s family, has been agonising over the case for years. The Florida legislature passed a law in 2003 to prevent an earlier attempt to let Ms Schiavo die. The Florida Supreme Court later ruled the measure unconstitutional.\\n',\n",

It is now up to Kewell - who is likely to have to pay his own legal costs in the case - to decide whether to pursue his action against Lineker, now a TV presenter, for a newspaper article he wrote in 2003. Shortly beforehand, Kewell had left debt-wracked Leeds United for Liverpool in a transfer worth $A11.7 million, $A2.7 million of which went to his personal manager, Bernie Mandic.

In court, Lineker, who scored 48 times in 80 appearances for England, insisted he did not regret the article at all. \"I haven\\'t apologised, to be perfectly honest, because nothing that I have heard or read since has changed my view on this,\" he said. \"It [the transfer] wasn\\'t transparent, and everything that I have subsequently learned about it has made it murkier and murkier. \"So, far from feeling the need to apologise I actually feel, if I am allowed to say this, vindicated.\" After the jury was dismissed, Lineker joked outside court: \"It looks like a replay.

Ms Macklin says there are bound to be problems when the Howard Government has cut $5 billion from Australian universities since taking power in 1996. \"The answer has to be in properly funding our universities and the Howard Government has an awful lot to answer for when it comes to the quality of education our students are receiving,\" he said.\\n',\n",

In a one paragraph announcement issued by the court, Justice O\\'Connor said it had been a great privilege to serve since 1981, when she was appointed by former president Ronald Reagan. She did not give a reason for retiring, but a court spokeswoman said Justice O\\'Connor needed to spend more time with her husband, who has Alzheimer\\'s disease. In a tribute to her, President George W Bush said Americans had high expectations of Justice O\\'Connor, and she had surpassed them. \"This great lady, born in El Paso, Texas, rose above the obstacles of an earlier time and became one of the most admired Americans of our time,\" he said. \"She leaves an outstanding record of service to the United States.\" Mr Bush, congressional leaders and lobby groups have weighed in on the news after months of girding for a fight over a potential vacancy on the top US court. \"Under the Constitution, I am responsible for nominating a successor for Justice O\\'Connor. I take this responsibility seriously. I will be deliberate and thorough in this process,\" Mr Bush said. \"The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court Justice that Americans can be proud of. \"The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair hearing and a fair vote.\"\\n',\n",

       " 'TEXT Melbourne businessman and entertainer Steve Vizard is facing fines and possible disqualification from acting as a company director over allegations he misused his position as a Telstra director to trade shares. The Australia Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) alleges Mr Vizard breached corporations law by using confidential Telstra information to trade in shares of three listed public companies. The businessman has agreed with documents lodged in the Federal Court that he contravened his duty to Telstra and that the court should determine any penalties. He is accused of using his insider Telstra knowledge to trade in the shares of Sausage Software Limited, Computershare Limited and Keycorp Limited. ASIC alleges that Mr Vizard instructed Creative Technology Investments (CTI), a company associated with him, to buy about $500,000 worth of Sausage Software shares on March 7 2000, 13 days before the software company announced to the market plans to merge with Solution 6. It says he told CTI to sell about $100,000 worth of Computershare stocks before Telstra announced its plans to divest itself of its 15 per cent minority stake in the company. ASIC says Mr Vizard also told CTI to buy $250,000 worth of Keycorp shares in July 2000, just days before Telstra unveiled plans to buy 51 per cent of the company. In each case, ASIC alleges that Mr Vizard had acquired confidential and price sensitive information from Telstra, and used it to instruct CTI\\'s investments. ASIC wants the Federal Court to fine Mr Vizard and ban him from company management. The case is due to proceed this month. At the same time, the Victorian Government has confirmed Mr Vizard has stood down from positions with the Major Events Corporation and the World Swimming Championships. Ron Walker, Mr Vizard\\'s friend and predecessor as head of the Major Events Corporation, says his decision to step down is a big loss for Victoria. Mr Walker says he hopes Mr Vizard can go back to the job when his court case is finished. \"It\\'s a very sad day for Victoria because Steve is a great servant of the state and he\\'s done a tremendous amount since he\\'s been chairman and I just earnestly hope that he can settle his differences,\" he said. The Australian Shareholders Association (ASA) has welcomed the action against Mr Vizard. But ASA deputy chairman John Curry says he is concerned about the time lag between the alleged breaches and today\\'s developments. \"This is five years ago that these events occurred,\" he said. \"If the capital markets as a whole are unsure about particular directors and their behaviour then why does it take five years for this information to filter through to ASIC?\" Premier Steve Bracks says it is appropriate that Mr Vizard has stepped down from two Victorian Government posts. \"Given these matters are coming before the courts, I think it\\'s appropriate that he tenders his resignation and I\\'ve received that,\" he said.\\n',\n",

Senator Ellison says he has already written to Qantas and Brisbane and Sydney airports to pass on a request for cooperation from Corby\\'s defence team. He says the Government has already shown it can cooperate quickly to bring a witness to the Indonesian courts as it did with the Victorian prisoner John Ford, but he says that will not necessarily work this time. \"We can\\'t compel a witness to travel to Indonesia if they don\\'t want to,\" he told Channel Nine. \"In John Ford\\'s case he was willing to do that.

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) found during the 2003-04 financial year, there were 5,000 claims active, of which 860 were finalised. Of those 860 cases, only 48 were settled by a court decision. In over half of those finalised claims, an amount of less than $10,000 or no payment at all was awarded.

He acknowledged that terror groups use Britain\\'s support of the US-led war in Iraq as a means to attract new recruits, but blasted the logic reiterated in a threat by Osama bin Laden\\'s Al Qaeda network on Thursday of more attacks in Britain unless British troops withdraw from Iraq. \"These very self same people who are making those remarks yesterday are the people supporting the killing of wholly innocent people in Iraq, wholly innocent people in Afghanistan, innocent people anywhere in the world who want to live by the rules of democracy,\" he said. \"And that is why, when they try to use Iraq or use Afghanistan or use the Palestinian cause as a means of saying, you know, \\'we have justification for what we do\\', it is a complete obscenity.\" Although the four July 7 bombers are dead and the main suspects from two weeks later are in custody, police have warned that London could face more attacks.

CMC chairman Robert Needham said it was clear from the two days of hearings the issues were complex and that included advertising. Mr Needham has questioned whether regulating advertising for legalised escort services would stop the sex industry expanding and direct business to those legal operators. A number of submissions to the CMC suggested newspapers should take more responsibility to ensure illegal brothels did not advertise in their publications. Mr Needham said escort ads were a large source of income for the print media and any restrictions would have to be tight enough to ensure newspapers could not get around them.\\n',\n",

A UN investigation into the kidnapping and murder last week of Saadoun Janabi was an \"urgent necessity,\" they wrote in a letter to UN secretary-general Kofi Annan as defence lawyers appealed for international protection. The letter emerged as Saddam\\'s Iraqi lawyer Khalil al-Dulaimi arrived in Amman to take part in talks on coordinating defence strategy for his next court hearing on November 28. Investigations by Iraqi and US officials into the murder \"will have no credibility,\" the letter signed by former Algerian president Ahmed Ben Bella, former Malaysian premier Mahathir Mohamad, French former foreign minister Roland Dumas and former US attorney-general Ramsey Clark says. Mr Janabi was kidnapped last Thursday, the day after Saddam and seven of his former henchmen went on trial over a Shiite massacre, and his body was found with bullets to the head dumped in a Baghdad neighbourhood. Mr Janabi, who was acting for Awad Hamad al-Bandar al-Sadun, a former chief judge of the revolutionary court and deputy head of Saddam\\'s office, was reportedly picked up by two trucks carrying armed uniformed men. US and Iraqi leaders \"have repeatedly expressed hostility toward the accused persons and both governments have resorted to criminal violence against supporters of the former government of Iraq,\" the letter said. The failure of US and Iraqi officials \"to provide protection to the defence and access to the defendants requires the transfer of any trials to a legal international forum if there is to be fairness in appearance and fact\". Saddam and his co-defendants face charges including murder and torture related to the killing of 148 Shiites from the village of Dujail following a failed attempt on the Iraqi leader\\'s life in July 1982. They all pleaded not guilty on Wednesday on the first day of the trial.

       " 'TEXT Lawyers for three Indonesian militants on death row over the 2002 Bali bombings are to make a final appeal to the Supreme Court after the men refused to seek a presidential pardon, one of the lawyers say. Achmad Michdan says he will ask the Supreme Court to review its decision to uphold earlier court decisions on the grounds the anti-terrorism law used to convict the men could not be used. In July last year, the Constitutional Court annulled a key piece of legislation that had allowed the anti-terrorism law - passed after the Bali attacks, to be used against the bombers retroactively. The legal option the lawyers will use is called a judicial review, and amounts to asking the Supreme Court to review its own decision. It is allowed only if new evidence is presented. \"This is the one reason for a judicial review, because those convicted could not be charged based on a law which did not exist when the incident took place,\" Mr Michdan told Reuters. The deadly blasts on the resort island in October 2002 killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists, with 88 Australians killed in the bombings. The death row convicts, Iman Samudra, Amrozi and Ali Gufron, played leading roles. Despite the Constitutional Court\\'s 2004 decision, authorities have said it would not affect the sentences against some 30 militants jailed over the Bali bombings because they were convicted in lower courts before that ruling. Balinese have been demanding the speedy execution of the death row bombers in the wake of fresh bomb blasts on the island on October 1 that killed 20 people. Since none of the three has sought presidential clemency, the judicial review will be their last barrier between execution by firing squad. Families of the three had also declined their chance to seek a presidential pardon on behalf of the men, but wanted lawyers to take any other necessary legal steps, Mr Michdan said.\\n',\n",

Mr Atkinson says the change tops-off legislation that already allows the seizure of assets if there is a high probability they were used in a crime. \"We wanted it to be clear that we regard assets, goods used as instruments of crime, to be subject to the same laundering laws as liquid assets,\" he said.

In May 2000, an armed group, including members of an elite military unit and led by businessman George Speight, -- invaded the legislature and held Fiji\\'s first ethnic Indian prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and his government hostage for 56 days. Mr Qarase\\'s government is now proposing amnesties for coup figures as part of legislation, which it says will help heal the social wounds caused by the overthrow. The legislation is opposed by the army, police, many civil groups and the country\\'s Indian minority, while many ethnic Fijians support it. A parliamentary committee presented a report on the Reconciliation, Tolerance and Unity Bill, recommending some changes to the key amnesty provisions but otherwise leaving them intact. Anyone guilty of murder, sexual offences, grievous bodily harm and offences against public order would not be able to apply for an amnesty, the report says. But those guilty of non-violent acts, illegal assembly and illegal demonstrations could apply for amnesty, the committee recommended according to Fijian media reports. Neither Mr Qarase nor Mr Chaudhry, who is now Opposition Leader, commented directly on the report but the Prime Minister said the proposals would be considered by the cabinet. \"We are hoping that exercise will be completed before the sitting of (parliament) in February,\" Mr Qarase was quoted as saying by the Fijilive online news service. \"We want to push it through parliament during that sitting,\" he said. Committee chairman Manasa Tugia said most of the organisations who made submissions on the bill supported it, while most individuals were opposed. Military chief Voreqe Bainimarama - who played a major role in ending the coup and arresting Speight in 2000, has been one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill. He has vowed to stop it being passed, raising fears of another coup. Mr Qarase\\'s government, which is backed by ethnic Fijian nationalists who took part in or supported the coup, faces elections next year. After the military took control of the country of 900,000 people after ending the coup, some of the major coup figures were arrested, including Speight who is now serving a life sentence for treason. Coup leaders said they mounted their 2000 attack on the parliament in the name of indigenous rights in Fiji where the ethnic Indian population makes up about 40 per cent of the population.\\n',\n",

Judge Eldon Fallon dismissed the five men and four women on the jury after they were unable to reach a verdict in more than three days of deliberations. \"I am disappointed that we did not get a verdict,\" Merck lawyer Philip Beck said on the courthouse steps. It was the third of thousands of civil cases filed against the pharmaceutical giant over a drug that has been linked to heart problems. Merck has vowed to fight the cases \"one-by-one\" and has so far had mixed results. In November, the second biggest US drug company won a product liability suit in New Jersey brought by a Vietnam veteran who suffered a heart attack after taking the blockbuster drug. That followed a Texas jury\\'s decision to award $US253 million to Carol Ernst, whose 59-year-old triathlete husband Robert died in May 2001 from heart failure after using Vioxx to treat pain in his hands. Merck intends to appeal that case. The latest case charged the pharmaceutical giant with causing wrongful death as a result of negligence, breach of warranty and failure to warn of side effects and fraud. The case is over the death of Richard Irvin, a married father of two, who died of a heart attack on May 15, 2001 after taking Vioxx for just a month. \"The family is not going to quit,\" lawyer Jere Beaseley told reporters. He said he was looking forward to a new trial in which he would be able to present the evidence which surfaced only after the jury began deliberating. Mr Beck would not speculate on whether jurors violated their pledge to ignore news reports on Merck and were thus influenced by the editorial. The editorial said risk levels were understated because the study failed to mention three incidences of heart attack among patients who took Vioxx. The journal also said that until last month, it believed that the study\\'s authors were unaware of the heart attacks when they published it. Recent testimony in the Irvin liability suit revealed that the authors appeared to knowingly omit the data.\\n',\n",

Pinochet, who ruled Chile for 17 years after leading a 1973 coup, must now face the first of a series of human rights charges against him related to Operation Colombo. During the operation in the mid-1970s, 119 members of an armed revolutionary group disappeared and are presumed dead. The panel of five judges from the Santiago-based Supreme Court ruled three versus two to reject the defence argument that Pinochet\\'s health problems, which include mild dementia caused by frequent mini-strokes, made him unfit to face a criminal process. He will face charges in six cases of people who disappeared during his dictatorship. The Supreme Court is still considering a separate appeal motion from the defence for three other cases related to the Colombo disappearances. \"The first instance for appeal has been confirmed as rejected, by three votes to two. The second appeal was left for [Tuesday],\" Judge Alberto Chaignau said. In the past five years, Chile\\'s courts have thrown out three human rights cases against Pinochet because of his poor health. However, some doctors on a new court-ordered medical panel have said he had exaggerated his symptoms. Pinochet\\'s legal woes have built in recent months as courts continue to strip him of his immunity on a case by case basis. Pablo Rodriguez, who leads Pinochet\\'s defence team, says the court ruling contradicts others in which the evidence against him was ruled insufficient. \"On the one hand he is said to be responsible [for crimes] and on the other hand there is no proof of that responsibility,\" Mr Rodriguez told local radio.

In November he was indicted for tax fraud and other crimes related to $US27 million hidden in foreign bank accounts.

The attack happened inside a share house at inner city Herston. In July 2003, music student Phil Evans returned home to find two balaclava-clad men, who bound him and chopped three fingers off his left hand. Today in the District Court, David William Ritchie pleaded guilty to seven charges, including grievous bodily harm, deprivation of liberty and serious assault. The court heard Ritchie pleaded guilty on the basis he was the getaway driver and not directly involved in the attack. Speaking outside court, Mr Evans said he still does not know why he was targeted. No one else has been charged over the attack.\\n',\n",

Tongsun Park, 70, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges including conspiring to act as an unregistered agent of Saddam Hussein\\'s former government and money laundering. Park was added to a previous indictment that now names 12 defendants, including Texas oil tycoon Oscar Wyatt, David Chalmers of Bayoil, Bulgarian oil trader Ludmil Dionissiev and two Swiss executives and their companies. Park is accused of taking more than $US2 million in Iraqi payoffs while secretly lobbying on behalf of Hussein\\'s government. He was arrested on January 6 in Houston and has remained in jail pending a decision on his bail, set to be considered at a hearing on Thursday. The indictment says that in 1993 Park met with an unnamed high-ranking UN official and an unnamed collaborator now cooperating with the investigation to set terms for getting business under the oil-for-food program. That meeting and a second meeting in Geneva that included two Iraqi officials were said to influence the 1995 UN resolution establishing the program. He was later paid by the Iraqi government for his efforts, including $US400,000 in cash in May 1996. The UN oil-for-food program began in 1996 to allow Iraq to sell oil to buy civilian goods for its people living under UN sanctions after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The program administered $US67 billion worth of oil, and US and UN investigations have found that lobbyists, UN and Iraqi officials took kickbacks and bribes. Park was also at the centre of the 1970\\'s \"Koreagate\" bribery scandal in Washington. A date of June 20 was previously set for Park\\'s trial.\\n',\n",

They say 28-year-old Renae Lawrence should serve a lesser term of 20 years if found guilty because she cooperated with investigators. Yesterday prosecutors called for the death penalty for accused ringleader Myuran Sukumaran, but life in prison for another alleged drug mule, 20-year-old Michael Czugaj. There had been some expectation that prosecutors may have treated Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen as one of the ringleaders because of evidence in the trial of his role in recruiting two alleged couriers, Scott Rush and Czugaj. But prosecutors spared him a submission calling for the death penalty, and they did the same for Si Yi Chen and the youngest of the nine, Norman.

Last week, Commissioner Terence Cole, QC, complained the wheat exporter was not fully cooperating with the inquiry. AWB\\'s lawyers today responded, saying the commissioner\\'s expectations were unreasonable, given the time available to prepare witness statements and the availability of documents. James Judd, QC, took to his feet today to deny that AWB had given the commissioner a facade of cooperation. Quite the reverse, Mr Judd described the nature of the hearings as an ambush, with evidence withheld from witnesses He said that they had provided general statements rather than more details because of time restrictions, and so as to allow further questioning at the hearing. But it was the questioning Mr Judd also took exception to. He said the inquiry had failed in all its obligations to be fair, courteous, respect the reputations of those in the witness box and avoid pre-judging. He took the counsel assisting\\'s questioning to task for ridiculing witnesses, specifically the managing director Andrew Lindberg, who was called \"a complete fool\", and had phrases such as \"Even a 12-year-old could understand this,\" put to him. Counsel assisting the commissioner, John Agius, rejected the submission, saying secret hearings were not unfair, witnesses had not been deliberately ridiculed and evidence had not been adjusted to fit a case theory. He maintained that AWB had not provided any meaningful statements and had avoided answering questions. Mr Agius said he was obliged to ask robust questions and duty bound to expose obfuscation, and he had no obligations under the Royal Commission Act to reveal content of secret hearings. The Commissioner is considering his response. Commissioner Cole has told lawyers for AWB that there are a large number of possible offences that will have to be considered by the inquiry. The commissioner also noted that he will be looking seriously at the corporate culture in AWB, which allowed the payment of almost $300 million to Saddam Hussein\\'s regime. Even the commissioner has appeared frustrated with the pace of this inquiry. An objection from Mr Judd about what could be considered as part of this inquiry was rejected by the commissioner for the moment. It related to a deal with a Pakistani agent for a multi-million dollar commission as a result of getting the AWB business in that country, which Mr Judd said was irrelevant. Commissioner Cole said not so, when considering the possibility of a corporate culture. \"It does seem to me that there are a large number of prospective offences under the Commonwealth Code that will have to be considered by this inquiry, and in relation to a significant number of them, the culture of the organisation may be a material matter,\" he said. Later, Mr Judd rose to his feet to question the inquiry\\'s ability to ask questions of Mr Geary about AWB\\'s public position. AWB has maintained publicly and to the Government it did not know that payments it was making for trucking to a company in Jordan called Alia were going immediately to the Iraqi Government. But a trip report was shown to the inquiry in which two paragraphs spelt out that money was being paid to the Iraqi Government. That report had been sent to all members of the Executive Leadership Group prior to a meeting to discuss it. But Mr Geary, one of the nine members of that group, said he could not remember seeing it. The commissioner responded by saying: \"It may well be that nine executives on the Executive Leadership Group didn\\'t read it. That would be a terrible indictment, if so.\" The inquiry\\'s questioning continues tomorrow.\\n',\n",

Customs regional director Paul O\\'Connor says the local Aboriginal community also spotted the boat and alerted authorities. \"It\\'s a good illustration of how both Customs and the local community are working together,\" he said. \"Our surveillance aircraft had picked it up, but at the same time we got a report from the local community and we\\'ve got excellent relationships up in that area with Indigenous communities\". The crew will be interviewed before being sent to Broome for medical examinations.\\n',\n",

       " 'TEXT Authorities in California have ordered Michael Jackson to shut down his Neverland ranch. The pop star has also been fined $US169,000 for failing to pay his employees or maintain proper insurance. Jackson\\'s sprawling ranch in the central California foothills has been closed, at least temporarily, by an agent of the state labor commissioner after the office discovered that his workers compensation policy had lapsed in January. \"We went out there this morning and issued a stop order to the security guard at the front gate,\" the state\\'s Department of Industrial Relations spokesman Dean Fryer told Reuters. \"We asked to be escorted in to meet management but we were refused and turned away so we gave the order to [the guard].\" Mr Fryer says local animal welfare officials have been asked to care for the inhabitants of Neverland\\'s zoo. He says that Jackson could reopen the ranch if he obtains workers compensation insurance but may face legal action by the state if he fails to pay the back wages. Jackson, who was cleared last June of criminal charges that he sexually abused a young boy at Neverland, has spent much of his time since the trial in Bahrain and was not at his ranch when authorities arrived. His representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. The order prohibits Jackson from employing anyone at the 1,130 hectare ranch until the insurance issues are resolved, Mr Fryer says. \"So it looks like this would mean for Neverland valley ranch that they would be closed down.\"\\n',\n",

Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who have both been sentenced to death, have both lodged appeals. Professor Don Rothwell, from the University of Sydney, says they have nothing to lose. But he says that is not the case for the others, who have been sentenced to life in jail. \"They really do have to seriously consider whether they will appeal because they could in fact not only be successful but also be unsuccessful and unsuccessful to the extent that the sentences could be increased from life sentences to possibly even the death penalty,\" he said. \"They\\'re really playing Russian roulette with the Indonesian court system. \"I think that the circumstances that Schapelle Corby found herself in when she sought to appeal her sentences last year through the Indonesian court system showed that there is the real prospect that not only can the Indonesian courts reduce the sentences ... but also raise the sentences again.\" Professor Rothwell says any appeal is a two-step process. \"Depending on the extent of the sentences, there would be the opportunity to appeal for clemency with the Indonesian President, and that would of course be especially important in the case of any of the Bali nine suffering the consequences of a death penalty sentence,\" he said. Scott Rush, who has been sentenced to life in jail, has decided not to appeal his sentence but move straight to an appeal for clemency. He will lodge it when the appeals of the rest of the Bali nine have been dealt with. Professor Rothwell says recent clemency appeals have not been very successful. \"Recent cases over the last few years would seem to suggest that the Indonesian President and indeed the Indonesian Government is not very sympathetic to these types of claims,\" he said. \"Partly because the Government has adopted a very hardline approach to the trafficking of drugs within Indonesia, not only by Indonesians but also by foreign citizens. \"So unless there\\'s some extraordinary development in terms of some new evidence becoming available, or there are other political factors, at the moment it would seem unlikely that appeals for clemency would necessarily succeed.\" The other members of the Bali nine are Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, Michael Czugaj, Matthew Norman, Renae Lawrence and Duc Thanh Nguyen.\\n',\n",
